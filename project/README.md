### The description:

The notebook for the part 1 can be found in 'jupiter_notebooks' folder (data investigation - part 1.ipynb), the visualisations were used to make the EDA more convenient. Data ingestion exists as a separate script to facilitate automation (data_ingestion_single_data_frame.py). The models are compared here: comparing_models.py. There are unit tests for the API (unit_tests/api_tests.py), for the model (unit_tests/models_tests.py) and for the logging (unit_tests/logging_tests.py). All tests can be run with a single script run_all_tests.py. The read/write unit tests are isolated from the production models and logs. Performance monitoring can be executed with logger.py. To test the api go to the website (first run app.py) and make a prediction (the way to do so is described on the main page). Everything is containerized (Dockerfile).
